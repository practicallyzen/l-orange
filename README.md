# l’orange — Support & Help

Welcome to **l’orange**. This page answers common questions, walks you through setup, and explains how to get help.

---

## What l’orange does

* Displays a **solid watch face color** that matches your **current heart‑rate zone**.
* Shows your **current heart rate** centered on the watch.
* Logs workouts and **time spent in each zone** (with emphasis on the orange zone) to Apple Health, when you choose to save.

> **Not a medical device.** l’orange is for fitness and wellness only.

---

## Requirements

* Apple Watch with heart‑rate monitoring enabled.
* iPhone (optional for setup/permissions).
* Apple Health permissions granted to read heart rate and write workouts.

> Exact OS/device compatibility is listed on the App Store product page.

## First‑time setup (Recommended)

1. Install **l’orange** on your Apple Watch (and iPhone if you use a companion app).
2. Open **l’orange** on the watch. On first launch you’ll be prompted to allow **Health** permissions:

   * **Read**: Heart Rate.
   * **Write**: Workouts (so your sessions can be saved to Health).
3. Start a workout in l’orange. Your watch face will turn the color of your heart‑rate zone; your heart rate is shown in the center.
4. When you end a workout, choose whether to **save to Health**. If saved, the session appears in Fitness/Health.

**If you skipped permissions:**

* On iPhone: **Settings ▶︎ Health ▶︎ Data Access & Devices ▶︎ l’orange** → enable Heart Rate (Read) and Workouts (Write).

---

## Trial & One‑time Unlock

l’orange includes a **14‑day evaluation**. After the trial, premium features require a **one‑time purchase (Full Unlock)**—no subscription.

* To unlock: open l’orange and tap **Buy Full Unlock**.
* Already purchased? Tap **Restore Purchases** (using the same Apple ID).

> Reinstalling the app does **not** reset the trial. Purchases can be restored at any time.

## How heart‑rate zones work

* l’orange displays the **zone colors** using the zones configured on your Apple Watch/Health.
* If your zones don’t match what you expect, review zone settings in the Apple Fitness/Health apps.

---

## Troubleshooting

**No color / stays gray**

* Ensure you have granted **Health ▶︎ Heart Rate (Read)** permission.
* Wear the watch snugly; wait 10–20 seconds for the optical sensor to stabilize.

**Workout isn’t saving to Health**

* Confirm **Health ▶︎ Workouts (Write)** permission is ON.
* End the workout inside l’orange and choose **Save** when prompted.

**Colors don’t match expected zone**

* Check your personal HR zones in Apple’s Fitness/Health settings.
* Large ambient temperature changes, tattoos, or loose bands can affect HR readings.

**Battery drain seems high**

* Continuous HR sampling uses power. Try a shorter screen‑on duration and ensure other power‑intensive apps are closed during workouts.

**Purchase/Restore issues**

* Make sure you’re signed in with the same Apple ID used to buy the **Full Unlock**.
* Open l’orange ▶︎ **Restore Purchases**.
* If the App Store dialog doesn’t appear, restart the watch/iPhone and try again.

## Data & Privacy (Summary)

* l’orange reads your **Heart Rate** to determine your zone.
* l’orange writes **workouts** you choose to save to Apple Health.
* **No analytics, no tracking, no external servers.** All data stays on your devices except what you explicitly store in Apple Health.

See the full **Privacy Policy** in the App Store listing.
